# Tetris
Hobby project for fun, it is a simple tetris copy to learn and improve in coding.

This project is using the PPKE ITK Hungarian University
student graphics learning kit (Alias flugigraphics) you can find it on github:
https://github.com/flugi/ITK_graphicslib.git

It is a simple graphics library, not the best, this code was written only to learn and 
prepare logic to make more advanced programs later with OpenGL.


This project includes all the files that you need to compile the code
and a working Codeblocks project included to make your life easier.
My experience is that you don't want to make this work with cmake or GNU vanilla. 
It is possible, but not recommended.
